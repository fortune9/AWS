## Purpose

Provide all kinds of functions used on the AWS EC2/S3 systems.

Here is a list of programs I wrote:

1. my\_insts: get the instances associated with current AWS user.

2. inst\_ip: get the IP addresses of current EC2 instance.

3. inst\_vol: get the associated volumes of current EC2 instance.

4. launch\_ec2.pl: launch an EC2 instance by providing parameters.

5. cp\_to\_s3: copy files/folders to a S3 bucket folder.

Run each program without any parameter to get usage information.

## Dependencies

For these programs to work, please install the following software:

1. AWS command line interface, downloadable
   [here](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

2. Bash, normally included in \*nix systems. In Windows, one can
consider git bash.
